# JEMICIT Blog — Final Web Development Project

Welcome to **JEMICIT Blog**, a responsive, multipage blog website designed and developed as part of the **Week 8 Final Assignment** for the PLP February 2025 Cohort.

## 🚀 Project Description

This blog is a reflection of my actual blogging experience at [jemicit.com](http://www.jemicit.com/?m=1), now reimagined as a fully responsive, modern website using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.

The website consists of three core pages:
- **Home** – A welcome section with an introduction to the blog and featured content.
- **About** – An overview of the blog’s background and author.
- **Contact** – A working contact form with JavaScript-based validation and confirmation.

## ✨ Features

- 🧱 Built with semantic **HTML5**
- 🎨 Styled using **CSS3**, with a responsive layout for all screen sizes
- ⚙️ Enhanced with **JavaScript** for:
  - Form validation
  - Interactive confirmation on submission
- 🌐 **Deployed via GitHub Pages**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
